# CarDataset_LinearReg_Ridge_Lasso
The aim of the project is to predict the price of cars given in a dataset using Ridge and Lasso regression.
As usual we start with data preprocessing.
But before preprocessing, an EDa is definitely needed: we've got 1000 rows and 6 independent (features) and 1 dependent (target) variables.
